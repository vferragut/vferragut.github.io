		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<img src="images/logo.jpg" alt="greenease_logo" style="width:225px; height:40px;">
		<p>Greenease is a mobile app that connects consumers to restaurants, cafes and grocers that buy from local or sustainable farms. Our goal is to educate consumers on where their food comes from when they dine out.
		</p>
		<p>Over the years we have heard from farmers that they'd like to sell to more chefs and restaurants. This helps them minimize waste and gets fresher foods to consumers in many more ways! Greenease is rolling out a new product that would allow farmers to post food products available for sale at the beginning, and end, of their market days, and target neighborhood restaurants ansd buyers.
