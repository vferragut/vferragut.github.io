			<h2 id="slogan">Connecting farms with buyers and chefs, and minimizing waste along the food chain.</h2>
			<p>Today's farmers are leaving farmers markets with leftover produce that goes to waste. Greenease for Farms allows farmers to list those products that they have leftover and connect with commercial buyers, such as restaurants, grocery stores, and other local businesses.</p>

			<h3 class="reasonswhy">Here are some reasons to participate!</p>
			<ul class="reasonswhy">
				<li>Farmers pack up less product to take back to the farm </li> 
				<li>Minimizes food waste from unsold food</li>
				<li>Chef get great, local produce at a lesser cost</li>
				<li>This encourages more farm-to-table menus if chefs are buying what's immediately available - a trend consumers are jumping on!</li>
			</ul>
