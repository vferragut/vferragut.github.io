		<h1>Why Farms Matter</h1>
		<p>Farmers are the backbone of our country. They grow the food we eat and share, and too often dispose of. These men and women, the unsung heroes of our food system, need the support of their communities - businesses, consumers, government - to thrive.

		<p>If you had something to eat today, don't forget to thank a farmer!</p>
